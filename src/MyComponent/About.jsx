            The visuals on your about pabox2ge make your brand more human. What’s
            even more important is to use visuals of real people, not stock
            photos. For instance, the HubSpot about us page has an image of our
            founders

          <p>
            Most about us pages include photos of staff — whether that be the
            C-suite, the founders, or all members of your team. If possible, opt
            for professional headshots on a neutral background.

          <h1>Use readable fonts.</h1>
          <p>
            Finding quality fonts is crucial when designing an about us page. If
            you want to use more than one font, tools like fontpair will provide
            you with excellent font combinations.
